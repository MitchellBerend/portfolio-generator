The portfolio-generator is a lightweight program designed to transform JSON
files into HTML pages. This tool offers a seamless conversion process, allowing
users to present structured data from JSON files in a visually appealing and
easily accessible format through web browsers.

This project was done to over engineer my own landding page. This landing page
is currently hosted on AWS cloudfront connected to an s3 bucket. There is a
github repo that contains some json files and a CI/CD workflow that generates
html files from all the json files in the repo, which then get pushed to the
aforementioned s3 bucket.
